‚öîÔ∏è The ultimate concurrency battle! Processes vs Threads face off.
CPU-heavy tasks? Processes rule! I/O waiting? Threads take the crown!
Choose your fighter wisely! ü•ä

The if __name__ == '__main__': protection is required when using multiprocessing 
to prevent child processes from re-executing the main module code during spawning.
